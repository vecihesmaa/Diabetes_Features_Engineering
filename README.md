# Diabetes Feature Engineering

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual has diabetes based on given features. Before building the model, comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering steps are applied to enhance model performance.

## Data Overview

The dataset contains medical records from a study on diabetes among **Pima Indian women** aged 21 and above. The dataset includes **768 observations** and **8 numerical independent variables**. The target variable indicates whether a person has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Project Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Perform an initial examination of the dataset.
2. Identify **numerical** and **categorical** variables.
3. Analyze these variables to understand their distributions.
4. Conduct target variable analysis to observe relationships with other features.
5. Identify and handle outliers.
6. Detect and process missing values.
7. Conduct correlation analysis to determine feature relationships.

### Task 2: Feature Engineering
1. Handle missing and outlier values appropriately.
   - Replace zero values in variables like **Glucose, Insulin** (which should not be zero) with missing values and apply appropriate imputation techniques.
2. Create new meaningful features from existing ones.
3. Apply encoding techniques for categorical variables.
4. Standardize numerical variables for better model performance.
5. Develop a machine learning model for diabetes prediction.

## Conclusion
This project enhances diabetes prediction using feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques. By improving data quality and creating meaningful features, the model is optimized for better accuracy in predicting diabetes status.
